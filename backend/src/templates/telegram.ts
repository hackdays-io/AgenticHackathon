# Task: Evaluate contributions from the past week and generate token transfer proposals.
The system has collected conversation records from the past week. Each record contains:
- **group_id**
- **user_id** (Telegram account ID)
- **text**
- **created_at**

From the conversation data, please first list all unique user accounts (telegram_id) along with the role they are associated with (represented as tokenId).  
**Note:**
- Do not use a non-existent user account.
- Do not specify a role that does not exist.
- Users with an associated role (tokenId) are considered **Sender** (i.e. {sender_telegram_id}).
- Users without a role become **Receiver** (i.e. {receiver_telegram_id}).

Next, for the Sender (the user who issued the /suggest command), evaluate their contributions and identify the Receiver with whom they have had the most "close" interactions—that is, count the number of times a message from the Sender is immediately followed by a message from that user.
For the selected Sender–Receiver pair, decide:
- The optimal token type (tokenId) for the transfer.
  - (For example, use "General".)
- The appropriate token transfer amount (amount) as the number of close interactions (or scaled appropriately).

# Output Message Format
For each proposal, generate a message strictly in the following format (without any additional commentary):

{sender_telegram_id}さん、日頃お世話になってる{receiver_telegram_id}さんに{tokenId}トークンを{amount}贈ってみるのはどうですか？

Please output **only** a plain text message in the above format.
